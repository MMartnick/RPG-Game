Create variables for and designate multiple attacker actions.

Choose two APIs to creatively incorporate (Exp: Weather API that changes background according to users location)
Potential APIs:
YouTube API
Google Maps (for user location)
World Clock API (For time)
Facebook API (for score sharing)
HearthstoneJSON API (Possible use of scraping Hearthstone data for character generation, requires a lot of research because I don't know anything about Hearthstone)
Poke API (Alternative to Hearthstone)
Discord API (for voice chat)


Adapt var turnCount to to be individual player characters speed utilizing a time out function. 

Incorporate Firebase for multiplayer, both versus mode and team mode (If time permits)

Timeline

begin with base working off of RPG Solution. 

start with adding 2 player characters in combat at once from the characters array. 
Scale up once this is functioning.

Implement timers during this process. 

Create seperate array for enemies.
(Versus mode will be based on the already existing game however thedisplay layout will change for each user swapping
the position of the characters on the battlefield. Seperate array will need to be created for displaying a different image of
the opposing players character.  

If Hearthstone API provides chracater statistics for that game use that data to generate enemy stats
(Alternatively Poke API could be used for the same thing and is simpler)
